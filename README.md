# Danger-Detection-Model

This Project is about Danger Detection from any video.
It, Detects the motion or activity in the video as classified, analysing those videos it then trains itself and in last shows if the is any thing dangerous going on or not.
The main motive and idea is of quick evaulation of the activities and awaring to provide help to stop it. 
Also to mention in that final code file there are 3 codes:
1. The code extracts the data points from the human activities according to classified and store it in a Dataset file
2. Then it uses the dataset file and trains the module and stored the trained data in the ".h5" file
3. The other file ".h5" file wil help then in 3rd code to detect danger or safe.
